### ⚡️ Quick Tool Mentions (`@`)

![mention](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a80dd48-1d95-4938-b0d8-431c02ec2a53)

Quickly call any registered MCP tool during chat by typing `@toolname`.  
No need to memorize — just type `@` and pick from the list!

You can also control how tools are used with the new **Tool Choice Mode**:
- **Auto:** Tools are automatically called by the model when needed.
- **Manual:** The model will ask for your permission before calling any tool.
- **None:** Disables all tool usage.

Toggle modes anytime with the shortcut `⌘P`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the recommended package manager.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Initialize project (creates .env, sets up DB)
pnpm initial

# 3. Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to get started.

-----

### Environment Variables

The `pnpm initial` command generates a `.env` file. Add your API keys there:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=****
OPENAI_API_KEY=****
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=****
```

SQLite is the default DB (`db.sqlite`). To use PostgreSQL, set `USE_FILE_SYSTEM_DB=false` and define `POSTGRES_URL` in `.env`.

# API keys for each provider
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
LOCALAI_API_KEY=your_localai_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key

# Optional attribution for OpenRouter
